# Duke's Frontier S Shields
A little mod to Frontier S Mk2 and Mk3 to X4: Foundations.

As it is now, you'll be able to buy the shield blueprints from the Terran representative. I may decide to add a way to get them through research through patching the research later, but this is good enough for government work.
